<h3>Trendlines in Technical Analysis</h3>
Since price patterns are identified using a series of lines or curves, it is helpful to understand trendlines and know how to draw them. Trendlines help technical analysts spot support and resistance areas on a price chart. Trendlines are straight lines drawn on a chart by connecting a series of descending peaks (highs) or ascending troughs (lows).

A trendline that angles up, or an up trendline, occurs where prices are experiencing higher highs and higher lows. The up trendline is drawn by connecting the ascending lows. Conversely, a trendline that is angled down, called a down trendline, occurs where prices are experiencing lower highs and lower lows.

Trendlines will vary depending on what part of the price bar is used to "connect the dots."

While there are different schools of thought regarding which part of the price bar should be used, the body of the candle bar—and not the thin wicks above and below the candle body—often represents where the majority of price action has occurred and therefore may provide a more accurate point on which to draw the trendline, especially on intraday charts where "outliers" (data points that fall well outside the "normal" range) may exist.


On daily charts, chartists often use closing prices, rather than highs or lows, to draw trendlines since the closing prices represent the traders and investors willing to hold a position overnight or over a weekend or market holiday. Trendlines with three or more points are generally more valid than those based on only two points.

Uptrends occur when prices are making higher highs and higher lows. Up trendlines connect at least two of the lows and show support levels below price.
Downtrends occur when prices are making lower highs and lower lows. Down trendlines connect at least two of the highs and indicate resistance levels above the price.
Consolidation, or a sideways market, occurs where price oscillates in a range between two parallel and often horizontal trendlines.
Types of Stock Chart Patterns
A price pattern that denotes a temporary interruption of an existing trend is a continuation pattern.

Continuation Patterns
A continuation pattern can be considered a pause during a prevailing trend. This is when the bulls catch their breath during an uptrend or when the bears relax for a moment during a downtrend. While a price pattern is forming, there is no way to tell if the trend will continue or reverse. As such, careful attention must be placed on the trendlines used to draw the price pattern and whether the price breaks above or below the continuation zone. Technical analysts typically recommend assuming a trend will continue until it is confirmed that it has reversed.
